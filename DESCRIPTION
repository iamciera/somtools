Title: Visualize Clusters in Kohonen Package
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person(“Ciera”, “Martinez”, email = “ciera.martinez@gmail.com”, role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: These are a bunch of functions I created to help me analyze specific 
	clusters when using the Kohonen R package.  These clusters likely will
	only work for this particular project, because of how specific my 
	cluster variables are. Sorry. Maybe someday I will make more generic. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
